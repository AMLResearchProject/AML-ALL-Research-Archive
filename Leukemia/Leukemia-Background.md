Leukemia is a cancer of certain white blood cells, located in the bone marrow where the cells are generated. As the disease progresses, the leukemic white blood cells swamp out other healthy blood cells. The disease causes failure of the blood system. Every year, in the United States, over 60,000 new patients are diagnosed with leukemia. Over 24,000 patients die from leukemia annually.

Like other cancers, there are many kinds of leukemia. The most common leukemias are four types, classified as chronic or acute, and myeloid or lymphoblastic (lymphocytic). Chronic leukemias tend to develop over several years whereas acute leukemias are more aggressive and develop over months. Myeloid or lymphoblastic leukemia refer to the specific types of white blood cells involved in the leukemia.

The different types of leukemias are associated with different symptoms, prognoses, treatments, and genetic causes. Part of making a correct diagnosis involves analyzing patients blood cells under a microscope after chemical staining, called a “blood smear”. Different leukemias are associated with different visual features of blood cells, such as their shape, color upon staining, and size.

Our project involves using the latest artificial intelligence methods for automated classification of leukemias from blood smears. Successful classification will aid physicians. We may also discover new blood smear features that can aid classification.
