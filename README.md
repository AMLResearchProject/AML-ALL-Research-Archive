The Peter Moss Acute Myeloid/Lymphoblastic Leukemia AI Research Project Archive documents public information, datasets, code and papers related to Acute Myeloid Leukemia and Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia that we come across through research and development.

# Project Research

Links to all public research papers, code, tutorials and datasets that we come across during the R&D of this project will be made available via the Research Archive as well as posts to the project Facebook page. We will also share project documentation for building and using our own networks as well as links to latest code releases on the project Github.

## Research Archives

Our research archives will contain all public information we are able to find that is related to Acute Myeloid/Lymphoblastic Leukemia if we feel the information is relevant. We also greatly appreciate community members that have had experiences with AML/ALL sharing their experience and advice to the community.

If you are not a dev/know how to use Github please email and it will be verified and uploaded on your behalf.

The primary research archives are as follows:

# About The Peter Moss Acute Myeloid/Lymphoblastic Leukemia AI Research Project

![The Peter Moss Acute Myeloid / Lymphoblastic Leukemia AI Student Program](Media/Images/Page-Banner.png)

The Peter Moss Acute Myeloid / Lymphoblastic Leukemia AI Research Project is an open source project with the goals of leveraging Artificial Intelligence to help detect AML/ALL and discover potential candidates for drugs to help combat the diseases. The project is in memory of Peter Edward Moss who lost his battle with Acute Myeloid Leukemia in August 2019.

The project is being coordinated by a group of volunteers with experience in computer vision / natural language processing, Leukemia research, Biochemistry, Molecular Biophysics, Immunology and Bioinformation.

The purpose of the project is to share public information related to AML/ALL, as well as open source projects aimed at early dectection with convolutional neural networks, using natural language understanding for AML/ALL chatbots, and R&D for discovering potential candidates for drugs for AML/ALL.
