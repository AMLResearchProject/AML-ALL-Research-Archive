The Peter Moss Acute Myeloid/Lymphoblastic Leukemia AI Research Project documents public information, datasets, code and papers related to Acute Myeloid Leukemia and Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia that we come across through research and development for the Peter Moss Acute Myeloid/Lymphoblastic Leukemia AI Research Project.

# Peter Moss Acute Myeloid/Lymphoblastic Leukemia AI Research Project
The  Peter Moss Acute Myeloid Leukemia/Lymphoblastic AI Research Project is an open source and free research and development project with the goals of researching and developing Artificial Intelligence to help detect AML/ALL and discover new drugs to help battle AML/ALL.

The project was started by Adam Milton-Barker to help him learn and understand more about Acute Myeloid Leukemia after a family member was diagnosed with the disease in 2018. Through the power of social media the project has been able to attract researchers. professors, students and developers from different countries around the world who have brought a higher level of research, testing and overall skills to the project.
The project is currently being researched, organized and developed by a group of volunteers with experience in Leukemia research, computer vision and Biochemistry & Molecular Biophysics among other areas expertise.  The official team is currently made up of:

- [Adam Milton-Barker](https://github.com/AdamMiltonBarker "Adam Milton-Barker") - Bigfinite IoT Network Engineer & Intel Software Innovator
- [Ho Leung Ng](https://github.com/holeung "Ho  Leung Ng") - Kansas State University, Dept. Biochemistry & Molecular Biophysics
- [John LaRocco](https://github.com/holeung "John LaRocco") - Former Humai Head of Engineering, LA, USA
- [Amita Kapoor](https://github.com/amita-kapoor "Amita Kapoor") - Associate Professor @ Delhi University, New Dehli, India
- [Estela Cabezas](https://www.facebook.com/Esteeelaa "Estela Cabezas") - Degree in Biotechnology @ Universitat de Vic, Catalunya, Spain

# Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML)
Despite being one of the most common forms of Leukemia, Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) is a still a relatively rare form of Leukemia that is more common in adults, but does affect children also. AML is an agressive Leukemia where white blood cells mutate, attack and replace healthy red blood cells, effectively killing them.

# Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL)
Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia is found in children and causes abnormally excesive ammount of white blood cells known as lymphocytes. This form of Leukemia is also known as Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia.

# Dataset
Although we plan to leverage and promote multiple datasets, the current project uses the [Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Image Database for Image Processing](https://homes.di.unimi.it/scotti/all/#download "Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Image Database for Image Processing") dataset provided by [Fabio Scotti, Associate Professor Dipartimento di Informatica, Universit√† degli Studi di Milano](https://homes.di.unimi.it/scotti/).

# Project Structure
The project is split up into multiple smaller projects. The current structure includes:
- [Peter Moss Acute Myeloid/Lymphoblastic Leukemia Project Research Archive](https://github.com/AMLResearchProject/AML-ALL-Research-Archive "Peter Moss Acute Myeloid/Lymphoblastic Leukemia Project Research Archive") 
- [Peter Moss Acute Myeloid/Lymphoblastic Leukemia Project Classifiers](https://github.com/AMLResearchProject/AML-ALL-Classifiers "Peter Moss Acute Myeloid/Lymphoblastic Leukemia Project Classifiers") 
- [Peter Moss Acute Myeloid/Lymphoblastic Leukemia Project Detection System](https://github.com/AMLResearchProject/AML-ALL-Detection-System "Peter Moss Acute Myeloid/Lymphoblastic Leukemia Project Detection System") 
- [Peter Moss Acute Myeloid/Lymphoblastic Leukemia Project Drug Discovery](https://github.com/AMLResearchProject/AML-ALL-Drug-Discovery "Peter Moss Acute Myeloid/Lymphoblastic Leukemia Project Drug Discovery") 

# Project Research
Links to all public research papers, code, tutorials and datasets that we come across during the R&D of this project will be made available via the Research Archive as well as posts to the projecr Facebook page. We will also share project documentation for building and using our own networks as well as links to latest code releases on the project Github.

# Community Driven
The project was initially create with the hope other developers and people in the medical industry may find the software and tutorials useful and may contribute back to the Github community helping improve the project. Feel free to submit pull requests with your suggested edits / bug fixes / additions to the related repositories on Github.
