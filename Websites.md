![Peter Moss Acute Myeloid/Lymphoblastic Leukemia AI Research Project Archive](Media/Images/research-archives-banner.png)

The Acute Myeloid/Lymphoblastic Leukemia AI Research Websites Archive provides an archive of all public Acute Myeloid/Lymphoblastic Leukemia related websites / online content that we come across during our R&D. We also greatly appreciate community members that have had experiences with AML/ALL sharing their experience and advice to the community.

# Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Image Database for Image Processing

The [Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Image Database for Image Processing](https://homes.di.unimi.it/scotti/all/) dataset is used for this project. The dataset was created by [Fabio Scotti, Associate Professor Dipartimento di Informatica, Università degli Studi di Milano](https://homes.di.unimi.it/scotti/). You will need to follow the steps outlined [here](https://homes.di.unimi.it/scotti/all/#download) to gain access to the dataset.

# Albumentations

# Hematology Atlas

The [Hematology Atlas Leukemias](http://hematologyatlas.com/leukemias.htm) dataset contains examples of various types of Leukemia. You can obtain permissions to use the dataset by contacting Dr. Nivaldo through the contact page on [Hematology Atlas contact page](http://hematologyatlas.com/contact.htm).

# ORGANIC (Objective-Reinforced Generative Adversarial Network for Inverse-design Chemistry)

[ORGANIC (Objective-Reinforced Generative Adversarial Network for Inverse-design Chemistry)](https://github.com/aspuru-guzik-group/ORGANIC "ORGANIC (Objective-Reinforced Generative Adversarial Network for Inverse-design Chemistry)") is an efficient molecular generation tool, able to create molecules with desired properties. It has a user-oriented interface, and doesn't require a HPC cluster. Feel free to check our article about ORGANIC and/or contact the developers if you have any issue or are interested in collaborations.

Thanks to [Ho Leung Ng](https://github.com/orgs/AMLResearchProject/people/holeung "Ho  Leung Ng") - Kansas State University, Dept. Biochemistry & Molecular Biophysics, the team has been granted permission from the developers to integrate their project into the [Acute Myeloid/Lymphoblastic Leukemia Drug Discovery Project](https://github.com/AMLResearchProject/AML-ALL-Drug-Discovery "Peter Moss Acute Myeloid/Lymphoblastic Leukemia Project Drug Discovery Project") which we are very grateful for!
