# Azacitidine (Vidaza®)

"Azacitidine (Vidaza®) is a chemotherapy drug used to treat conditions that affect the blood and the bone marrow, called myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). It may also be used to treat other cancers, such as acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) or chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia (CMML)."

Blood tranfusions along with Vidaza® is what kept Peter alive for his year long battle with Acute Myeloid Leukemia.
